App Name: Quote

Quote is a private and anonymous chat app that allows users to express themselves honestly within invite-only groups or communities. While conversations are anonymous, users are required to sign in to join or create groups — this helps control access and protect group integrity. The app saves messages and group data online so users can access their conversations across devices.

Core Idea:
A secure, anonymous space where people can talk freely, ask questions, share experiences, or seek advice without fear of being exposed — but with controlled access through sign-in and private group invites.

Main Features and Concepts:
- Users must sign in to access the app
- Users can create or join private chat groups
- Each group functions like a closed, anonymous room
- All conversations are saved online and synced across devices
- No one can see anyone else's identity, even inside groups
- Users can pin messages they find meaningful or want to revisit
- Every message is anonymous but tied to a real, signed-in session
- Users receive invite links to join specific communities
- The app feels lightweight, mobile-first, and respectful of privacy
- People use Quote to vent, share feelings, confess, or support one another without judgment

The purpose of Quote is to blend the safety of anonymity with the reliability of user accounts — making it easy to express yourself while still keeping your space secure and manageable.
